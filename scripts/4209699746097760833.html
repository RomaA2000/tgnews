      <p>The ongoing trial of Founder of Sotitobire Miracle Centre Akure, Ondo State, Alfa Babatunde, over the disappearance of one-year-old boy, Gold Kolawole, in his church was on Monday stalled. </p>
      <p>The case was stalled following the absence of the state’s Attorney-General, Adekola Olawoye, in court.</p>
      <p>Babatunde Falodun, one of the representatives of the prosecution counsel, informed the court that the inability of the Attorney-General to be present in court was due to an urgent state assignment.</p>
      <p>However, counsel to the defendants, Olusola Oke, didn't oppose the application of the prosecution.</p>
      <p>The presiding judge, Justice Olusegun Odusola, thereafter adjourned the case until June 2, 2020.</p>
