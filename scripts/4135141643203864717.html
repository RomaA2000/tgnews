      <h1>Wild’s Dubnyk, NHL goalies trying to stay in shape during hiatus</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2020-04-27T00:40:26+00:00">27 Apr 2020, 00:40</time> by <a rel="author">AP</a></address>
      <p><b>TORONTO —</b> <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/vancouver-canucks-team">Vancouver Canucks</a> goalie <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/jacob-markstrom-player">Jacob Markstrom</a> is using a tennis ball machine as part of his training to stay sharp.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/columbus-blue-jackets-team">Columbus Blue Jackets</a> counterpart <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/joonas-korpisalo-player">Joonas Korpisalo</a> doesn’t have that technology at his disposal during the coronavirus pandemic, so a wall has had to do the trick.</p>
      <p>Toronto’s <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/frederik-andersen-player">Frederik Andersen</a> is self-isolating with teammate and 47-goal man <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/auston-matthews-player">Auston Matthews</a>.</p>
      <p>“I have a pretty good shooter here,” Andersen said.</p>
      <p>No matter the setup, NHL puck-stoppers are, at least on the surface, at a disadvantage when it comes to maintaining most of their physical skills during the lull since the season was suspended March 12.</p>
      <p>Unlike skaters, who might have a net in the driveway or the ability run through a stick-handling drill, goalies are having a hard time mimicking situations that even loosely resemble practice or game situations.</p>
      <p>“We’re doing our best and working a lot on hand-eye,” Markstrom said. “Don’t let your eyes fall asleep is a big thing.”</p>
      <p>Winnipeg’s <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/connor-hellebuyck-player">Connor Hellebuyck</a> said:</p>
      <p>“No one’s been through this before. There’s really no book, no right way. I’m not able to strap on the pads. That’s the most important part about being dialed in as a goalie, getting a feel and really getting the workload. Going for a run isn’t going to keep me in goaltender shape.”</p>
      <p>Many goalies are leaning on their private trainers.</p>
      <p>While a team’s strength and conditioning coach has to formulate programs for more than 20 players, people like Adam Francilia, whose NHL clients include the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/san-jose-sharks-team">San Jose Sharks</a>, Hellebuyck, Minnesota’s <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/devan-dubnyk-player">Devan Dubnyk</a> and Carolina’s <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/james-reimer-player">James Reimer</a>, develop plans specifically for netminders.</p>
      <p>“In some cases they have really great home gyms at their disposal,” Francilia said. “And then there’s some guys in a condo with nothing … but I have enough stuff in my repertoire that guys only need their body weight to train.”</p>
      <p>John Stevenson, a performance psychologist and former NHL goalie coach, said he always instructs his netminders to work on blocking outside noise.</p>
      <p>“The coronavirus is an uncontrollable,” he said. “We don’t have control over the uncontrollables, but we definitely have control over how we choose to respond.”</p>
