      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari has extended the lockdown in Lagos, Ogun and Federal Capital Territory until May 4.</p>

      <p>He said, “In line with the recommendations of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, the various Federal Government committees that have reviewed socio-economic matters and the Nigeria Governors Forum, I have approved a phased and gradual easing of lockdown measures in FCT, Lagos and Ogun States effective from Monday, 4th May, 2020.</p>

      <p>“However, this will be followed strictly with aggressive reinforcement of testing and contact tracing measures while allowing the restoration of some economic and business activities in certain sectors.  See Also <a href="http://saharareporters.com/breaking-news">Breaking News</a> <a href="http://saharareporters.com/2020/04/27/breaking-president-buhari-extends-lockdown-lagos-ogun-fct-until-may-4-curfew-begin-after">BREAKING: President Buhari Extends Lockdown In Lagos, Ogun, FCT Until May 4, Curfew To Begin After Then</a> <a href="http://saharareporters.com/2020/04/27/breaking-president-buhari-extends-lockdown-lagos-ogun-fct-until-may-4-curfew-begin-after#disqus_thread">0 Comments</a> 1 Hour Ago</p>
      <p>“Furthermore, new nationwide measures are to be introduced as follows.</p>
      <p>“There will be an overnight curfew from 8pm to 6am. This means all movements will be prohibited during this period except for essential services.</p>
      <p>“There will be a ban on non-essential inter-state passenger travel until further notice.</p>
      <p>“Partial and controlled interstate movement of goods and services will be allowed for the movement of goods and services from producers to consumers.</p>
      <p>“We will strictly ensure the mandatory use of face masks or coverings in public in addition to maintaining physical distancing and personal hygiene.</p>
      <p>“Furthermore, the restrictions on social and religious gatherings shall remain in place. State Governments, corporate organisations and philanthropists are encouraged to support the production of cloth masks for citizens.</p>
      <p>“For the avoidance of doubt, the lockdown in the FCT, Lagos and Ogun States shall remain in place until these new ones come into effect on Monday, 4th May 2020.”</p>
