      <p>The Peoples Democratic Party has raised the alarm over alleged looting of funds at the Niger Delta Development Commission.</p>
      <p>The party also called for investigation of those responsible for diverting funds meant for developmental projects to personal use.</p>
      <p>He noted that the development had completely crippled the commission from delivering on its mandate to the people of the region.</p>
      <p>The statement reads, "The PDP noted that the public space is already awash with allegations of looting of billions of naira in NDDC meant for the development of the area through shady contracts, diversion of funds and sleazy procurement deals by officials in a manner akin to earlier exposed looting in the National Health Insurance Scheme.</p>
      <p>“The party rejects the attempt by the NDDC management to divert attention from the issues at stake, particularly by alluding to faceless detractors while at the same time opting for internal investigation on the N5.5bn COVID-19 contract allegation, instead of referring the matter to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.</p>
      <p>"Our party therefore urges the National Assembly to commence an investigation into the books of the NDDC under the present management, recover the looted funds and channel the money to the projects meant for the well being of Nigerians as contained in the budget of the commission." </p>
