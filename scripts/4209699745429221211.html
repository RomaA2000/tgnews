      <p>The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People has lamented the impact of the outbreak of Coronavirus on Ogoni communities, describing it as very severe.</p>
      <p>The group also decried the distribution of palliatives by the government, saying it was not being evenly distributed.</p>
      <p>He said, "Although we understand the impact of the lockdown on the people, we seem not to have any choice than to avoid contacts with people and our people must understand how much this can help save lives amid severe hunger now being experienced.</p>
      <p>“It is a good thing that there are currently no cases of the infection in Gokana and no kingdom has reported any case but there is no testing going on so we cannot rule out any possibilities."</p>
      <p>Nsuke stated that the approach used in the distribution of relief materials in the state was capable of spreading the virus as there might be some cases amongst those, who assemble for the food items.</p>
      <p>He added, “The current approach where crowds gather under the sun for loaves of bread and noodles is not only derogatory but can also aid the spread of the virus.</p>
      <p>"Rather than encouraging crowds in the distribution centres, the government can consider supplying the foodstuff to designated retail outlets at controlled prices. </p>
      <p>"It is therefore important that whatever intervention at this time should be done with consideration for the dignity and safety of our people."</p>
