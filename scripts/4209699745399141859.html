      <p>Two officers of the Nigerian Army and two policemen have tested positive for Coronavirus in Borno State.</p>
      <p>The four are among the 30 confirmed cases in the state.</p>
      <p>A source told SaharaReporters that two of the cases were recorded at the 7 Division Medical Services and Hospital in Maimalari Cantonment, Maiduguri, the state capital, while the remaining cases were at Pulka, a town under Gwoza Local Government Area.</p>
      <p>“On April 26, a soldier, Sergeant Michael Ahmadu (97NA/45/6722) and Mrs Rahab A. Augustine, who are both staff of 7DMSH, tested positive to the COVID 19. Contact tracing has been activated.</p>
      <p>“Families of the confirmed patients and all 7DMSH staff who came in contact with the patients are been quarantined. </p>
      <p>“More isolation wards to hold suspected cases are being provided,” the source said.</p>
      <p>SaharaReporters gathered that another soldier and a policeman also tested positive for COVID-19 in Pulka.</p>
      <p>The two, who are presently being treated in the town, are likely contact of the state index patient that died of the virus.</p>
      <p>The index case, a 56-year-old nurse working for Medicine Sans Frontier in Pulka, died on April 19.</p>
      <p>“With this development, I think it’s time for the management of 7DMSH to adequately train it's personnel on handling of COVID-19 patients and this should be escalated to the level of the NAMC.</p>
      <p>“HQ TC should ensure enforcement of preventive measures in all units across the theatre. Comds/COs should ensure social distancing for troops on parade or in operation,” the source added.</p>
